#### Icons
I used Font Awesome Icons in this project and are basically provided on this link [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and are **easly applied** to your website, used in __moderation__ and are self explanatory as you will be seeing.

### Fonts:
For this project I'm going to use Sans Serif and JP [Noto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP) however I found this would be a great much the project .

### Colors:
1. I have sofar picked up four types of colors, and in my understanding they will make the weather app project look quiet pretty and in appearance looks promising.
2. These are the colors am gonna use in my project.

These are the main colours that am gonna use in this weather project.

* For body text and some titles: White #ffffff;
* For the the background image: Oxford Blue #14213D;
